  <h3>About 12Stone</h3>

  <p>
    12Stone Church exists so future generations will know the rescuing hand of God.
  </p>
  <p>
    We believe that every person matters to God and matters to us. <b>#OneMatters</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    We believe God calls us to pursue him just as we are, inside and out, so we nurture
    a casual, fun and inviting atmosphere. As our guest, you can check out our services
    without intrusion and begin your spiritual journey at your own pace.
